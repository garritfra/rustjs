## Thinking in Rust

Aside of the obvious type system stuff, I think there are a few core differences
between Rust and JS:

### Namespaces
In Rust, imports are always done through
namespaces, and namespaces kind of behave like structs.

```rust
// println comes from the "std" namespace -- print something to the screen.
std::println!("hello world");

// Call the "new" method from the `HashMap` type from the `std::collections`
// namespace
let hashmap = std::collections::HashMap::new();
```

### Classes & Structs
Structs don't have "constructor" methods the way JS do; instead you define a
method that returns `Self` (which is a shorthand for the name of the struct).

```js
/// How to instantiate:
/// ```js
/// let rect = new Rectangle(5, 10);
/// ```
class Rectangle {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
}
```

```rust
/// How to instantiate:
/// ```rs
/// let rect = Rectangle::new(5, 10);
/// ```
pub struct Rectangle {
    height: usize,
    width: usize,
}

impl Rectangle {
    /// Create a new instance.
    pub fn new(height: usize, width: usize) -> Self {
        Self { height, width }
    }
}
```

### Expressions!
Everything is an expression. Which is to say: blocks suddenly have a lot more
meaning, and you can do some fun substitutions.

These are all equivalent:
```rust
let y = 1 + 1;
let x = y * y;
if x == 4 {
    println!("hello world");
}
```

```rust
// If we omit the `;` from a statement, it becomes the return value of the
// block it's in.
let x = {
    let y = 1 + 1;
    y * y
};
if x == 4 {
    println!("hello world");
}
```


```rust
// Expressions means that you can inline almost anything. Don't actually do this
// please.
if {
    let y = 1 + 1;
    y * y
} == 4 {
    println!("hello world");
}
```

### Know your `self`
There are 3 kinds of self: `self`, `&self`, `&mut self`.

```rust
pub struct Rectangle {
    height: usize,
    width: usize,
}

impl Rectangle {
    pub fn new(height: usize, width: usize) -> Self {
        Self { height, width }
    }

    /// Get the height
    ///
    /// We want to reference the value as read-only,
    /// so we use `&self` for shared access.
    pub fn height(&self) -> usize {
        self.height
    }

    /// Set the height
    ///
    /// We want to reference the value as "writable", so we use
    /// `&mut self` for exclusive access.
    pub fn set_height(&mut self, height: usize) -> usize {
        self.height = height
    }

    /// Get the height + width as a tuple.
    ///
    /// We want to "consume" the current struct, and return its internal parts.
    /// So instead of taking a reference, we take an owned value `self` after
    /// which the struct can no longer be used, and return a tuple (anonymous
    /// struct) containing its internals.
    pub fn parts(self) -> (usize, usize) {
        (self.height, self.width)
    }
}
```

This is the core of everything around the borrow checker. If you have exclusive
access to a variable, nobody else can have access to that variable too and you
can mutate it. If you have shared access to a variable, others may too, but
you're not allowed to update the value. That's how data races are prevented!

There's some escape hatches using `RefCell`, `Mutex` and other things to get
around this; but they apply clever tricks internally to uphold the same
guarantees at runtime rather than compile-time. Less efficient, but same rules!

That's it! Everything else is basically an application of these rules.

### Options
Instead of using `opts` or default values, most things use builders instead.
Kind of the way [`superagent`](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent) works:

```js
let opts = {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'X-API-Key': 'foobar',
    'accept': 'json'
  }
};

try {
  let res = await fetch('/api/pet', opts);
} catch(err) {
  throw err
}
```

```js
superagent.post('/api/pet')
  .set('X-API-Key', 'foobar')
  .set('accept', 'json')
  .end((err, res) => {
    // Calling the end function will send the request
  });

```

```rust
let res = surf::post("/api/pet")
    .set_header("X-API-Key", "foobar")
    .set_header("accept", "json")
    .await?; // Calling .await will send the request
```

Internally builders generally take `self`, and return `self` as the output so
you can chain the methods together.

### `?` and `.await`

In Rust:
- `?` is for error handling; it says: "if it's an error, return the error, if
    it's not an error, return the value".
- `.await` is like `await` but you can chain it just like any other property.

Speaking of `.await` though. Do yourself a big favor and start with
_synchronous_ Rust first. Starting with async Rust is going full throttle on
hard mode, and I can guarantee it's going to be confusing.

Start easy. Do synchronous Rust for a bit. Skip HTTP. Don't do timeouts. Try,
uhh, other things first. Loops, and printing stuff to the console. Maybe even
borrowing if you're feeling cheeky.
